COMP 1006: Web Programming using PHP

PHP based application that will recreate a virtual replica of the user’s closet.

This application will allow users to upload information about the clothes in their closet.
It includes descriptors such as type, color, and season. 
Once the information uploaded, the website will serve as an interface where the user can log how many times each item is used, add comments, and ultimately, have an application that will easily display and classify all of the items that the user has. 
This application eliminates the need to rummage through the user’s closet which in turn, means less time spent dressing, a more organized room, and the possibility for more innovative clothing combinations.
